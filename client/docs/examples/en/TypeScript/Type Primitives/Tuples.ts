// Typically an array contains zero to many objects of a
// single type. TypeScript has special analysis around
// arrays which contain multiple types, and where the order
// in which they are indexed is important.

// These are called tuples. Think of them as a way to
// connect some data, but with less syntax than keyed objects.

// You can create a tuple using JavaScript's array syntax:

const failingResponse = ["Not Found", 404];

// but you will need to declare its type as a tuple.

const passingResponse: [string, number] = ["{}", 200];

// If you hover over the two variable names you can see the
// difference between an array ( (string | number)[] ) and
// the tuple ( [string, number] ).

// As an array, the order is not important so an item at
// any index could be either a string or a number. In the
// tuple the order and length are guaranteed.

if (passingResponse[1] === 200) {
  const localInfo = JSON.parse(passingResponse[0]);
  console.log(localInfo);
}

// This means TypeScript will provide the correct types at
// the right index, and even raise an error if you try to
// access an object at an un-declared index.

passingResponse[2];

// A tuple can feel like a good pattern for short bits of
// connected data or for fixtures.

type StaffAccount = [number, string, string, string?];

const staff: StaffAccount[] = [
  [0, "Adankwo", "adankwo.e@"],
  [1, "Kanokwan", "kanokwan.s@"],
  [2, "Aneurin", "aneurin.s@", "Supervisor"],
];

// When you have a set of known types at the beginning of a
// tuple and then an unknown length, you can use the spread
// operator to indicate that it can have any length and the
// extra indexes will be of a particular type:

type PayStubs = [StaffAccount, ...number[]];

const payStubs: PayStubs[] = [
  [staff[0], 250],
  [staff[1], 250, 260],
  [staff[0], 300, 300, 300],
];

const monthOnePayments = payStubs[0][1] + payStubs[1][1] + payStubs[2][1];
const monthTwoPayments = payStubs[1][2] + payStubs[2][2];
const monthThreePayments = payStubs[2][2];

// You can use tuples to describe functions which take
// an undefined number of parameters with types:

declare function calculatePayForEmployee(id: number, ...args: [...number[]]): number;

calculatePayForEmployee(staff[0][0], payStubs[0][1]);
calculatePayForEmployee(staff[1][0], payStubs[1][1], payStubs[1][2]);
