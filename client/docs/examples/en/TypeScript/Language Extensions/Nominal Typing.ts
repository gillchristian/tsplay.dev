// A nominal type system means that each type is unique
// and even if types have the same data you cannot assign
// across types.

// TypeScript's type system is structural, which means
// if the type is shaped like a duck, it's a duck. If a
// goose has all the same attributes as a duck, then it also
// is a duck. You can learn more here: example:structural-typing

// This can have drawbacks, for example there are cases
// where a string or number can have special context and you
// don't want to ever make the values transferrable. For
// example:
//
// -  User Input Strings (unsafe)
// -  Translation Strings
// -  User Identification Numbers
// -  Access Tokens

// We can get most of the value from a nominal type
// system with a little bit of extra code.

// We're going to use an intersectional type, with a unique
// constraint in the form of a property called __brand (this
// is convention) which makes it impossible to assign a
// normal string to a ValidatedInputString.

type ValidatedInputString = string & { __brand: "User Input Post Validation" };

// We will use a function to transform a string to
// a ValidatedInputString - but the point worth noting
// is that we're just _telling_ TypeScript that it's true.

const validateUserInput = (input: string) => {
  const simpleValidatedInput = input.replace(/\</g, "â‰¤");
  return simpleValidatedInput as ValidatedInputString;
};

// Now we can create functions which will only accept
// our new nominal type, and not the general string type.

const printName = (name: ValidatedInputString) => {
  console.log(name);
};

// For example, here's some unsafe input from a user, going
// through the validator and then being allowed to be printed:

const input = "alert('bobby tables')";
const validatedInput = validateUserInput(input);
printName(validatedInput);

// On the other hand, passing the un-validated string to
// printName will raise a compiler error:

printName(input);

// different ways to create nominal types, and their
