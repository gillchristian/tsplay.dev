// Tiny devices may not be very good for writing code, but
// they are good for reading our examples, or giving
// someone's link a quick review and making some minor
// edits.

// With the new Playground, we've improved the small screen
// experience by:

//  - Removing menu items which aren't related to code.
//  - Some minor style improvements.
//  - Switch to a single pane editor. This means you
//    can't see the transpiled JS.

// This should make the experience less painful.
