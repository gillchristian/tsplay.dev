// With the new Playground, URLs contain a lot more
// information about your settings. This makes reproductions
// accurate, and you don't have to tell someone to hit a
// particular compiler flag to replicate your setup.

// The URL contains:
//
// - Whether you are on an example
// - The gzipped source code for your TypeScript/JavaScript
// - Backwards compatibility for older non-gzipped URLs
// - Which language you are working in
// - The diff of your compiler settings from the defaults
//   example:new-compiler-defaults
// - Your text selection if you have some code highlighted
//
// The URL is updated live when any of the above changes
// using HTML5's replaceState, so your back button will
// still work as expected.

// When loading an example, you'll see an occasional e=[number]
// which is used to ensure the browser correctly reloads when
// you jump between examples. It's harmless.

// You can see the URL change on this page by editing some
// of the comments, or start selecting some text. Pressing
// reload on your browser will take you back to the same
// state.
