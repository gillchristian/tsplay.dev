## Localization

( Work in progress on migrating localization to the OSS playground.)

Like the rest of this website, the TypeScript Playground is localized. As of 2021, the current list of supported languages are:

- [`es`](/es/play)
- [`fr`](/fr/play)
- [`id`](/id/play)
- [`ja`](/ja/play)
- [`ko`](/ko/play)
- [`pt`](/pt/play)
- [`vo`](/vo/play)
- [`zh`](/zh/play)

Ideally this helps folks for whom English is a second language!
