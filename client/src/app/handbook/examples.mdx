## Examples

The Playground examples are an interactive set of tutorials, and overviews into parts of TypeScript with a very tight focus. They are not as comprehensive as [the TypeScript handbook](/docs/handbook/intro.html), but they aim to offer a 2nd explanation (with different metaphors and ideas) inside comments of a Playground which invites the writer to fidget with the code and see how the pieces come together.

Speaking as the author, I, _Orta_, think there are many ways for people to learn a complex subject. I don't think it's possible to just pick up a single book and _" :tada: I understand X."_ We're not learning kung-fu in a second, something like TypeScript takes a while to learn.

I believe that studying something complex revolves around creating a mesh of understanding by mixing learning and doing. The TypeScript handbook does a great job of covering all the primitives of TypeScript, and you can study it, but with the Playground we have a space for a 2nd explanation on the same topics with an environment structured for play and safe failure. The Examples in the Playground are built to encourage exploration of ideas.

You can access the examples via the Playground toolbar for both "Examples" and "What's New" - there's also links in the footer of every page (except the homepage.)

The Playground examples are structured into 3 main sections:

- **TypeScript** - covering type syntax primitives, terms which may be new to people, and language extensions
- **JavaScript** - showing how TypeScript types can interact with runtime code, how to work with different environments and existing JavaScript structures
- **What's new** - Per-release feature specific explanations of new language changes

The examples that you have read are tracked in your browser via `localStorage`, and you get see a blue dot next to something you have read in the dropdown. If that blue dot is empty, it means the example has been updated since you last read it.
